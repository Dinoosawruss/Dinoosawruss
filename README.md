### Hi, my name is Michael ðŸ‘‹
I am an incoming Degree Apprentice at IBM!

I am currently awaiting results for my A-Levels in Computer Science, Politics, Mathematics and Law. <br>
I mostly work with .NET, Python, Go, and Java. However, I am well versed in a variety of languages and generally consider myself a polyglot programmer.

My biggest projects so far have been my A-level Computer Science Coursework [(a Turing Machine Simulator)](https://github.com/Dinoosawruss/tm-sim), [StatMC (Arhived)](https://github.com/Dinoosawruss/StatMC) and [Automatic Smart Revise (Archived)](https://github.com/Dinoosawruss/Automatic-Smart-Revise)

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on [MVRetailManager](https://github.com/MVRetailManager), which will be one of my most major projects yet
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Go and Blockchain
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
