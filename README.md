### Hi, my name is Michael 👋
I am currently studying A-Levels in Computer Science, Maths, Politics and Law at sixth form,
I mostly work with Python and I really enjoy making Discord.py bots, I also work with C# and Front-End Web Development however, I am using C# much more now as it is the language we primarily focus on at college.

My biggest projects so far have been [StatMC](https://github.com/Dinoosawruss/StatMC) and [Automatic Smart Revise (Archived)](https://github.com/Dinoosawruss/Automatic-Smart-Revise)

I am currently working on [Concept C](https://github.com/Dinoosawruss/Concept-C)

In the future I wish to do a degree apprenticeship in Digital & Technology Solutions at IBM
